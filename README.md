# Clever Quest
A critical thinking game that we have created for your friends, family or whoever you want to play with for our project!
I have specifically worked on the backend part of the code.
I have written the code for Trivia game, Guess the number where the game logic was implemented using websockets.
Also for playing in groups, multi-player vs multi-=player, we had servers.
I have writtern the code for server, profile, log-in and password-reset.
I have also written the code for Problem reports and complaints feature.
I have implemented these features with the help of Java, Springboot framework, mySql, MariaDB.
